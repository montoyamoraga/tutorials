## About

tutorial-power-supplies is a tutorial about how to choose and what consider when using a power supply, building a simple power supply out of batteries, common power supplies, and commercially available power supplies.

## Introduction

There are a lot of power supplies to choose from.

Electrical power supplies transmit power, which is the product between voltage and current. They provide a fixed voltage, and they transmit as much current as needed by the device to comply with the power requirements.

Power supplies usually connect to mains voltage



## Parameters

* Input voltage
* Output voltage
* AC or DC
* Current rating
* Polarity
* Physical connector


### Input Voltage

Power supplies need an input. They usually connect to a mains outlet. In USA, mains outlets are 110 XX volts AC. In Japan, they are 120 XX volts AC. In most of the world it is 220 or 230 volts AC. The corresponding XX do a table instead of plain text.



### Output voltage

### AC or DC

### Current rating

### Polarity

In the case of DC, you need to know if the connection is center-positive, or center-negative. The barrel that transmits the output of the power supply consists of an outer conductor and an inner conductor.

A center-positive power supply outputs the voltage on the inside and ground on the outside.

A center-negative power supply outputs the voltage on the inside and ground on the outside.

### Physical connector

There are several diameters of barrels. XX Check the 1Spot and research about propietary ones if any. Remember the PROCO Rat and EHX Big Muff ones.

## Safety

Voltage ranges, overheating, common mistakes

## Batteries

### Power supplies out of batteries

## Voltage regulators

Voltage regulators are integrated chips that consist of three terminals:


*

There are several flavors

LM7812l LM7805


### Some standards

Guitar effect pedals 9Vdc center negative

Synthesizers 9Vdc center positive

Propietary connectors, Apple Magsafe and Magsafe 2, Apple Lightning.

Power through USB, USB-C Arduinos, cellphones






## Commercial alternatives and examples

Truetone 1Spot power supply

VoodooLab

Laboratory power supplies
